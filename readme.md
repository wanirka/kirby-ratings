Full id that goes to the page that the user is voting for.

**data-title**

The title of the page in the modal.

### Blueprint

**Just to be safe**

The five rating values stored in the content are counters. Just to be sure you can add them in your blueprint as well.

```
fields:
  rating_1: rating_hidden
  rating_2: rating_hidden
  rating_3: rating_hidden
  rating_4: rating_hidden
  rating_5: rating_hidden
```

**Rating in the panel (optional)**

To show your rating in the panel, you need to add a field for it.
